# Pasting.Win
cheating.win is big paste, uses btbd hwid spoofer lmfao.



Credits to: 
BTBD for his hwid spoofer so level can paste his driver no problem

z175 and his friends @wlan @DarthTon @vmcall @fisherprice for kdmapper

Cheating.Win does a lot of rebrands, and one of them is strawberry (please do not give hate to disrupt, he did not know this untill i dumped it.)
then i got my hands on strawberrys loader, and decided to give it a shot since level is a huge dickhead paster cunt, after a few hours, i was doing it
all wrong, as bitch had disabled every loader, so i decided look into the memory trick, little did i know that after 10 minutes i had the driver in my 
debugger, i dumped it to a file, fixed a few issues like (relocation and shit), then it was like a driver from levels pc  but more like driver from btbd's 
hwid spoofer repo lmfao. in conclusion level / nexlevel is the same retarded kevin paster which i raped a few months ago, who just knows slightly more so
he can paste and be not that obvious. oh and btw kevin if ur reading this, can u please not lie to me next time? cuz this is the only driver which is
referenced in ur kdmapper, so ur driver is obviously not streamed so yeah lol GG.


Filename for driver posted in this github, "C:\Windows\Strawberry - serial.tmp" you can write anything to it and load driver, and it will change serial to that :)
