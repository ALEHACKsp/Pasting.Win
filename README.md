# Pasting.Win
cheating.win is big paste, uses btbd hwid spoofer lmfao.



Credits to: 
BTBD for his hwid spoofer so level can paste his driver no problem

z175 and his friends @wlan @DarthTon @vmcall @fisherprice for kdmapper

Cheating.Win does a lot of rebrands, and one of them is strawberry (please do not give hate to disrupt, he did not know this untill i dumped it.)
then i got my hands on strawberrys loader, and decided to give it a shot since level is a huge dickhead paster cunt, after a few hours, i was doing it
all wrong, as bitch had disabled every loader, so i decided look into the memory trick, little did i know that after 10 minutes i had the driver in my 
debugger, i dumped it to a file, fixed a few issues like (relocation and shit), then it was like a driver from levels pc  but more like driver from btbd's 
hwid spoofer repo lmfao. in conclusion level / nexlevel is the same retarded kevin paster which i raped a few months ago, who just knows slightly more so
he can paste and be not that obvious. oh and btw kevin if ur reading this, can u please not lie to me next time? cuz this is the only driver which is
referenced in ur kdmapper, so ur driver is obviously not streamed so yeah lol GG.
